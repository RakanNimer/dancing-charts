# dancing-spreadsheets

Reads google spreadsheets and converts them to animated charts.

## Demo & Examples

Live demo: [RakanNimer.github.io/dancing-spreadsheets](http://RakanNimer.github.io/react-dancing-spreadsheets/)

To build the examples locally, run:

```
npm install
npm start
```

Then open [`localhost:8000`](http://localhost:8000) in a browser.


## Development

Fork the repo and clone it.
```npm install
```
To build, watch and serve the examples (which will also watch the component source), run `npm start`. If you just want to watch changes to `src` and rebuild `lib`, run `npm run watch` (this is useful if you are working with `npm link`).
